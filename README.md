How to:

Download the script from GitHub

If you will be prompted to download the Python runtime, do it.
Switch the dark/light mode in macOS, iTerm2 should change color
If your script does not work after you restart iTerm2,
make sure that Preferences -> Magic -> Enable Python API is checked and this setting is saved.
